## Why is it a problem?
  
Chatbot development challenges significantly impact the success of chatbots in fulfilling their intended purpose. Here are some of the impacts of these challenges:

**Customer Satisfaction:**
  Chatbots are often deployed to improve customer satisfaction by providing quick and efficient support. However, if chatbots cannot effectively address customer needs, it can lead to dissatisfied customers and a decrease in customer loyalty.

  Chatbots have become increasingly common, and businesses that do not have effective chatbots may struggle to compete with those that do.
