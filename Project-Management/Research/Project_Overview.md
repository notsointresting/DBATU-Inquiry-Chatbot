# Project Overview üöÄ

  Chatbots automate workflows and free up employees from repetitive tasks. A chatbot can also eliminate long wait times for phone-based customer support, or even longer wait times for email, chat and web-based support, because they are available immediately to any number of users at once.
    
## Problem Statement ü§î
  
   The problem statement regarding chatbots before LLMs is the lack of clear guidelines for their use in academic.
Chatbots face several problem statements before the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). One problem is the lack of accurate and reliable information provided by chatbots. LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have limitations in speaking accurately about events that occurred after their training. Lastly, there is a lack of consensus on the standards for using LLMs like ChatGPT in academic medicine, highlighting the need for guidelines and transparency in their use .


## Objectives üéØ


- ### Improve accessibility:
  Provide a convenient and easily accessible platform for prospective students to inquire about admission procedures, eligibility criteria, deadlines, and other relevant information.
- ### Enhancing Customer Service:
   One of the primary objectives of many chatbot projects is to improve customer service by providing quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, thus enhancing the overall customer experience.
- ### Streamline application process:
   Guide students through the application process step by step, helping them fill out forms, upload documents, and complete required tasks efficiently.

## Pros and Cons üëçüëé

### Pros

- _**24/7 Availability:**_
  
   A chatbot can provide assistance to prospective students, applicants, and even enrolled students round the clock, allowing them to get answers to their queries at any time, irrespective of office hours.
- _**Scalability:**_

  As the number of applicants may vary significantly during admission cycles, a chatbot can handle multiple inquiries simultaneously without the need for additional staff. This scalability ensures that every applicant receives timely assistance.
- _**Quick Response Times:**_

  With automation, chatbots can instantly respond to common inquiries regarding admission criteria, application procedures, deadlines, and required documents. This saves both the applicants' and staff's time, reducing waiting periods and improving efficiency.

### Cons

- _**Lack of Personalization:**_

  Chatbots, especially those based on predefined algorithms, may struggle to provide the level of personalized interaction that prospective students often seek during the admission process. They might not be able to address unique questions or concerns effectively.
-  _**Limited Scope of Assistance:**_

  Chatbots are typically programmed to handle specific tasks or inquiries related to admission, such as providing information about application deadlines, required documents, or program details. They may not be equipped to handle complex or nuanced queries beyond their predefined functions.


- _**Technical Issues and Errors:**_

  Like any technology, chatbots can experience technical glitches, errors in responses, or system failures. If not properly maintained and updated, these issues could frustrate users and potentially deter them from engaging with the chatbot or the university's admission process.

## Future of the Project üöÄ

  In the near future, when AI is combined with the development of 5G technology, businesses, employees, and consumers are likely to enjoy enhanced chatbot features such as faster recommendations and predictions, and easy access to high-definition video conferencing from within a conversation. These and other possibilities are in the investigative stages and will evolve quickly as internet connectivity, AI, NLP, and ML advance. Eventually, every person can have a fully functional personal assistant right in their pocket, making our world a more efficient and connected place to live and work.


## Applications and Use Cases ü§ñ
-  _**Answering FAQs:**_

     Chatbots can handle frequently asked questions about admission requirements, deadlines, application procedures, financial aid, campus facilities, and more. This reduces the workload on admission staff and provides immediate assistance to prospective students.
- _**Application Assistance:**_

  Chatbots can guide students through the application process, helping them fill out forms, upload documents, and understand the necessary steps required for successful submission.
- _**Program Information:**_

  Chatbots can provide detailed information about different academic programs, including curriculum details, faculty profiles, research opportunities, and career prospects, helping students make informed decisions about their choices.

## Technology Stack üíªüîß

- Programming Language:

   - Python is commonly used for building chatbots due to its simplicity, large number of libraries, and strong support for 
     natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP):

     - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy: Python libraries for NLP tasks such as tokenization, parsing, and named 
       entity recognition.
     - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) or GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): Pre- 
       trained models for more advanced NLP tasks like question answering and dialogue generation.
- Machine Learning Frameworks:
    - TensorFlow or PyTorch: For building and training machine learning models, particularly for tasks like intent         
      classification and entity recognition.
- Web Framework:
    - Flask or Django: For building the backend of the chatbot, handling HTTP requests, and integrating with other systems.]
    - Frontend Framework:
        React, Angular, or Vue.js: For building the user interface of the chatbot, if it's going to be a web-based                    application.

- Database:
     - MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite: For storing user data, chat histories, and other relevant information.
