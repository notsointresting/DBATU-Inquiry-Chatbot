## Introduction

DBATU Admission Inquiry Chatbot is a user-friendly tool that provides information and answers to common questions related to the admission process at Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University.

### Approaches

In the prototype of the final project, three different approaches have been explored:

1. **Creating chatbot using NLP and DNN:**
   - In the first approach, we built a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to provide quick and accurate responses to admission-related queries. You can explore the code and details in the [NLP-DNN Approach Folder](https://github.com/notsointresting/DBATU-Inquiry-Chatbot/tree/main/Approach_1).

2. **Llama2 and PaLM2 API Integration:**
   - The second approach involved integrating the Llama2 and PaLM2 APIs to create a chatbot that leverages external APIs for a seamless admission inquiry experience. You can find more information in the [Llama2-PaLM2 Approach Folder](https://github.com/notsointresting/DBATU-Inquiry-Chatbot/tree/main/Approach_2).

3. **Ongoing Development with LangChain, Azure, and OpenAI:**
   - Our third approach, currently under development, aims to incorporate LangChain, Azure, and OpenAI for an even more advanced and intelligent admission chatbot. Stay tuned for updates and check out the progress in the [LangChain-Azure-OpenAI Approach Folder](link_to_folder).

We continuously strive to improve the chatbot based on the guidance and insights provided by our mentor and through research into various articles and resources. This project represents our commitment to enhancing the admission process at DBATU.
