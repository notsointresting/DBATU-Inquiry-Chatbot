# Chatbot using Llama and PaLM 2 API

## Introduction

In this article, we will explore how to create a chatbot using the Llama and PaLM 2 API. Llama is a Python library that provides tools for building and deploying conversational AI models, while PaLM 2 is an API developed by Google that allows us to generate text using large language models.

## Key Concepts

Before we dive into the code, let's understand some key concepts:

- **Llama:** Llama is a Python library that simplifies the process of building and deploying conversational AI models. It provides tools for natural language understanding, dialogue management, and text generation.

- **PaLM 2:** PaLM 2 is an API developed by Google that allows us to generate text using large language models. It is based on the PaLM (Parameterized Language Model) architecture, which is designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

- **VectorStoreIndex:** VectorStoreIndex is a class provided by Llama that allows us to index and search text documents based on their semantic similarity. It uses embeddings to represent the documents and performs efficient nearest neighbor search.

## Code Structure

The code provided can be divided into the following sections:

- **Installation:** The code begins with the installation of the required libraries using pip.

- **Importing Libraries:** The necessary libraries are imported, including llama-index, pypdf, google-generativeai, transformers, and others.

- **Loading PDF Files:** The code creates a directory called "data" and loads the PDF files from that directory using the SimpleDirectoryReader class.

- **Text Chunking and Embedding:** The text from the PDF files is split into small chunks and embeddings are created for each chunk using the PaLM library. The ServiceContext class is used to configure the parameters for chunking and overlapping.

- **Indexing:** The VectorStoreIndex class is used to create an index from the documents. This index allows us to perform efficient search operations based on semantic similarity.

- **Storing and Loading the Index:** The index is stored using the storage_context.persist() method, which saves the index to disk. This allows us to load the index later without having to recreate it from scratch.

- **Q/A:** The code sets up a query engine using the index and enters a loop where it prompts the user for input and generates a response based on the query. The response is displayed using the Markdown class.

## Advantages

- By integrating the PaLM2 model, we can generate meaningful responses based on the input query.
- Llama_index provides a powerful and efficient way to search through large collections of documents and retrieve relevant information.
- PaLM2 API is free.

## Disadvantages

- May produce incorrect information.
- Does not have a conversation buffer.
